# Project Overview (Movie_Analysis_Dashboard)
In this project, I created an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze and visualize data related to movies. The dashboard provides actionable insights into key performance indicators (KPIs), trends, and comparisons, empowering stakeholders to make data-driven decisions.

### Dataset Used
- Movie Dataset including columns such as title, genres, vote count, vote average, revenue, popularity, budget, release date, IMDb rating, and IMDb votes.

# Features 
### 1. Data Import and Transformation
- Imported raw movie data into Power BI.
- Leveraged Power Query Editor to clean, preprocess, and transform the dataset for accurate analysis.
- Created calculated columns and measures for key metrics using DAX.

### 2. Interactive Visualizations
- Designed intuitive visualizations such as bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, and treemaps.
- Visualized movie KPIs such as audience scores, popularity, and revenue across genres, release years, and other categories

### 3. Dynamic Buttons and Bookmarks
- Implemented buttons and bookmarks for seamless navigation across pages.
- Created a Landing Page with navigation options (Control Panel, Reset Button and Close Button) for improved user experience and storytelling <a href="https://github.com/ash-ashutosh/Movie_Analysis_Dashboard/blob/main/Screen%20Shots/Control%20Panel%20Using%20Book%20Mark%20and%20Button.jpg">View Control Panel</a>
- Made toolkit if you hover on any movie it will show you details about it <a href="https://github.com/ash-ashutosh/Movie_Analysis_Dashboard/blob/main/Screen%20Shots/Summary%20Toolkit.jpg">View On Hover Tookkit</a> 

### 4. Filtering and Slicing
- Incorporated dynamic slicers and filters to enable users to slice and dice data by attributes such as:
     - Genres
     - Release Year
     - Director
     - IMDB Rating
     - Actor and Writer
- Users can drill down and slice data by various attributes like they can see through drill through which director have made what movie and avarage IMDB rating with average length of movie. <a href="https://github.com/ash-ashutosh/Movie_Analysis_Dashboard/blob/main/Screen%20Shots/Director%20Drill%20Through.jpg">View Drill Through Option</a> 

### 5. Key Metrics
- Highlighted the following key performance indicators (KPIs):
   - Total Movie Count: The total number of movies in the dataset.
   - Average IMDB Rating: The average vote or rating given by users.
   - Top Rated Movies: Movies with the highest IMDb ratings and vote averages.
   - Director Insight: Total Movies made by director under which production and couttry.
   - Actor Insight : Total movie made by actor in different films, relation with Director and writer.


# Skills Demonstrated
### Data Processing and Modeling
- Imported and cleaned data from diverse sources using Power Query.
- Built complex relationships and data models for comprehensive analysis.
  
### Visualization and Design
- Designed intuitive and visually appealing dashboards.
- Used DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to create calculated measures and columns for advanced analysis.
  
### Interactivity and User Engagement
- Created an interactive dashboard with dynamic filters, slicers, and bookmarks.
- Implemented buttons for enhanced navigation and storytelling.
  
### Collaboration and Sharing
- Published the dashboard for stakeholders to access and interact.
- Used Power BI Service for sharing and collaboration.

# Tools and Technologies Used
